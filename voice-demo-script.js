    welcome: {
        greeting: "Yo, what's up! Welcome to our product demo! I'm Jahmal, your AI-powered product guide, and listen... I promise this demo is gonna be way more entertaining than that last Zoom meeting you fell asleep in. *laughs* Don't worry, I saw nothing. But for real though, I'm about to show you some stuff that's actually gonna blow your mind instead of putting you to sleep!",
        
        introduction: "Alright, so here's what we're gonna do in the next few minutes. I'm gonna walk you through our main features without using any of those scary technical words that make your brain hurt. We'll look at some real-world examples, and I'll show you how this can transform your business. And the best part? We're gonna have fun doing it!",
        
        engagement: "You know what I love about doing these demos? Every business is different, which means I get to show you exactly how our platform can solve YOUR specific problems. Not your neighbor's problems, not some generic business problems - YOUR problems. Ready to see some magic happen?"

        heroSection: {
            primary: "Perfect! So here we are on our main landing page. Now, this is typically the first thing your potential customers see, and let's keep it 100 - first impressions matter. You get one shot to not bore people to death, and I think we nailed it!",
            
            secondary: "Check out this headline: 'Transform Your Business with AI' - now I could give you the typical corporate speech about 'digital transformation' and 'paradigm shifts' *yawn* ...but let's be real. This is just fancy talk for 'we make your work life way easier.' Simple as that!",
            
            callToAction: "And peep this bright green 'Get Started Free' button! The color choice isn't random - we use this neon green because it's basically screaming 'CLICK ME!' without being that annoying popup that follows you around the internet. You know the ones I'm talking about!"
        },
        
        featuresSection: {
            transition: "Now, let's talk features. But hold up - I'm not gonna stand here and read you a boring list like I'm taking attendance. I'm gonna show you why each feature is about to change your life. Well, your work life at least!",
            
            performanceFeature: "First up - lightning-fast performance. Now, I know EVERYONE says they're 'fast,' but let me put this in perspective. We're talking about processing thousands of requests per second. That's like... if your computer was The Flash, but instead of running around Central City, it's just being really good at its job. Your customers get instant results, and happy customers? They stick around AND they tell their friends!",
            
            aiPoweredFeature: "Next up, our AI-powered automation. Okay, this is where things get spicy! Imagine having a super smart assistant who never needs coffee breaks, never calls in sick, and definitely never judges you for eating pizza for breakfast. That's what our AI does for your business. It's like having a superpower, but for boring stuff like data processing!",
            
            securityFeature: "And security - oh boy, this is where we get serious for a hot minute. We're not talking about that 'password123' level security. We're talking bank-level encryption, compliance with every major standard, and security so tight, even WE can't peek at your data without permission. Because trust? That's everything. It's like the foundation of a house - you don't see it, but without it, everything falls apart!"
        },
        
        demoSection: {
            introduction: "Now, here's where it gets fun! This is our interactive demo section. A lot of companies just show you screenshots like they're showing vacation photos. But we believe in letting you actually test drive before you buy. It's like a car dealership, but for software, and way less pushy!",
            
            interactiveElement: "See this dashboard interface? This isn't just a pretty picture to look at - it's fully functional! You can click around, explore different features, and really get a feel for how smooth everything is. Go ahead, click on whatever catches your eye. I'll wait... *dramatic pause* ...pretty cool, right?",
            
            sidebar: "Notice how clean this sidebar navigation is? We spent months - MONTHS - perfecting this because we know that if software is confusing, it doesn't matter how powerful it is. People will just stare at it like it's written in ancient hieroglyphics. We kept it simple because life's complicated enough already!",
            
            widgets: "These widgets showing real-time data? Performance metrics, user activity, system health - everything you need to run your business is right here. No more jumping between 47 different tools and spreadsheets like you're playing digital hopscotch. One dashboard to rule them all!"
        },
        
        pricingSection: {
            transparency: "Let's talk pricing, and I'm gonna be straight with you - no hidden fees, no surprise charges, no 'contact us for pricing' nonsense that makes you feel like you're buying a car. Here's exactly what everything costs, clear as day!",
            
            starterPlan: "Our Starter plan at $29 per month is perfect for small businesses just getting their feet wet. You get up to 1,000 API calls, basic analytics, and email support. It's like training wheels for your business - designed to let you test the waters without diving into the deep end!",
            
            professionalPlan: "Now, this Professional plan at $99 per month? This is our sweet spot, our bread and butter, our 'chef's kiss' moment! Most customers choose this because it gives you everything you need to scale - 10,000 API calls, advanced analytics, priority support, and custom integrations. It's like upgrading from a bicycle to a sports car!",
            
            enterprisePlan: "And for the big players, we have our Enterprise solution. This is fully customizable, unlimited everything, 24/7 support, and we can even set it up on your own servers if you're into that whole 'control freak' thing. The pricing is custom because, honestly, every enterprise has different needs and different budgets. We're flexible like that!"
        },
        
        dashboardDemo: {
            transition: "Now, let me show you something that's gonna make you say 'wow' out loud. I'm taking you to our actual dashboard interface. This is where the magic happens on a day-to-day basis, where the rubber meets the road, where... okay, I'll stop with the metaphors!",
            
            navigation: "Watch this smooth transition... *whoosh* ...and boom! Here we are! This is what your team would see every morning when they log in. Clean, organized, and no unnecessary clutter. It's like Marie Kondo organized your software!",
            
            performanceWidget: "Look at this performance widget showing 98.5% uptime. That's not just a number we made up to sound impressive - that's reliability you can actually count on. When your customers need your service, it's there. Like that one friend who always shows up when they say they will!",
            
            userWidget: "2,847 active users right now. This real-time data helps you make decisions based on what's actually happening RIGHT NOW, not yesterday's reports that are already ancient history. It's like having a crystal ball, but for your business!",
            
            alertsWidget: "And this alerts widget showing 3 items that need attention? The system is smart enough to prioritize what actually matters, so you're not drowning in notifications like your phone after you forget to mute the group chat. Only the important stuff gets through!",
            
            activityFeed: "This activity feed keeps you in the loop on everything happening in your system. System backups, optimizations, alerts - it's like having a pulse on your entire operation. You know, like a heartbeat monitor, but for your business instead of your cardiovascular system!"

    interactiveResponses: {
        pricing: {
            question: "Ooh, great question about pricing! I love when people ask the real questions!",
            answer: "Here's the beautiful thing about our pricing model - it grows with your success! You start small with the Starter plan, and as your business grows and you're making more money, you naturally move up to plans that offer more value. We designed it so the ROI is always positive. You're never paying more than you're getting back. It's like investing in a really good coffee machine - costs money upfront, but pays for itself every morning!"
        },
        
        integration: {
            question: "Integration? Oh man, this is actually one of our strongest points!",
            answer: "We have pre-built connectors for over 200 popular business tools. Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Workspace - if you use it, we probably integrate with it. And if we don't? Our custom integration service can build it for you. It's like having a universal adapter for your business software!"
        },
        
        security: {
            question: "Security is absolutely critical, and I'm glad you asked! This is serious business time!",
            answer: "We're SOC 2 compliant, GDPR compliant, and we encrypt everything - data at rest, data in transit, even the data that's just thinking about moving. We also do third-party security audits quarterly because trust, but verify, right? Your data is safer with us than it is in your own office filing cabinet. I can back that up with more certifications than a helicopter pilot!"
        },
        
        support: {
            question: "Our support is something I'm genuinely proud of, and I don't say that lightly!",
            answer: "We don't just fix problems - we prevent them! Our AI monitors your account 24/7 and often fixes issues before you even know they exist. It's like having a really good friend who fixes your flat tire before you even notice it's flat. When you do need help, our average response time is under 2 hours, and our customer satisfaction rating is 98.7%. We're not just a vendor - we're your tech-savvy best friend!"
        },
        
        roi: {
            question: "ROI is the most important question you can ask! I respect that business mindset!",
            answer: "Our average customer sees a 300% return on investment within the first year. How? Time savings, reduced errors, increased efficiency, and better decision-making. We actually track this for you in the dashboard, so you can see exactly how much value you're getting. It's like having a personal accountant who only counts the good news!"

    // Closing and Next Steps
    closing: {
        summary: "So here's what we've covered today: a platform that's lightning-fast, AI-powered, secure, and designed to scale with your business. We've shown you real features, real pricing, and real results. No smoke and mirrors, just straight facts with a side of personality!",
        
        valueProposition: "The question isn't whether this platform can help your business - it's whether you can afford NOT to have these capabilities. While your competitors are still doing things the old way, you could be leveraging AI to work smarter, not harder. It's like choosing between a horse and a car - both will get you there, but one's definitely gonna be more fun!",
        
        urgency: "Here's what I'd suggest: start with our free trial. No risk, no commitment, no awkward phone calls from sales people. Get your hands on the platform, see how it works with your data, and experience the difference firsthand. It's like test driving a car, but for software!",
        
        nextSteps: "I can set you up with a free trial right now, or if you have more questions, I can connect you with one of our solution specialists who can dive deeper into your specific use case. They're like me, but with more technical knowledge and less jokes. What sounds better to you?",
        
        personalTouch: "And remember, I'm here whenever you need me. Whether you're just getting started or you're ready to scale to the enterprise level, I'll be your guide through every step. Think of me as your AI tour guide, but for business software instead of tourist attractions!"

            setup: "Excellent choice! Let me get you set up with a free trial right now. I'll need just a few details to create your account, and you'll be up and running faster than you can say 'artificial intelligence.' We're talking less than 2 minutes here!",
            credentials: "I'm sending you login credentials to the email address you provided. You'll also get a welcome email with some quick-start tutorials, but honestly, the platform is so intuitive, you might not even need them. It's like getting instruction manual for a sandwich - technically helpful, but probably unnecessary!",
            support: "And remember, during your trial, you have full access to our support team. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need help setting anything up. We're here to help, not to judge your technical skills!"
        },
        
        consultation: {
            scheduling: "Perfect! I'd love to connect you with one of our solution specialists. They're like me, but they know even more technical stuff and can do a deeper dive into your specific industry and use case.",
            preparation: "Before that call, I'll send you a brief questionnaire. It's not a pop quiz, I promise! It just helps us understand your current setup and challenges so we can make the most of your time. No one likes wasted time, especially in business!",
            value: "These consultations typically run about 30 minutes, and most people leave with a clear roadmap for implementation, whether you choose our platform or not. It's genuinely helpful, not just a sales pitch disguised as a consultation!"
        },
        
        objections: {
            price: "I understand cost is always a consideration - we all got bills to pay! But let me ask you this: what's the cost of NOT having these capabilities? How much time does your team spend on manual tasks that could be automated? How many opportunities are you missing because you don't have real-time insights? Sometimes the most expensive option is doing nothing!",
            
            timing: "I get it - timing is everything, and there's never a 'perfect' time to implement new software. But here's the thing: every day you wait is a day your competitors might be getting ahead. The good news? Implementation is faster than you think. Most customers are seeing results within their first week. That's faster than most people take to assemble IKEA furniture!",
            
            complexity: "Actually, that's exactly why we built it this way! We know business software has a reputation for being more complex than rocket science. Our entire design philosophy is 'powerful but simple.' You shouldn't need a computer science degree to use business software. If my grandmother could use it - and she still thinks the internet is a series of tubes - then you can definitely use it!"
